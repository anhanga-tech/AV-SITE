## 2025-05-15 - [Strict Scoping of Performance Tasks]
**Learning:** In performance-focused tasks with strict constraints ("ONE small improvement"), bundling multiple optimizations—even if individually valid—can lead to rejection and potential build risks (e.g., missing imports). Prioritizing a single, high-impact reusable component optimization (like memoizing a common UI element) is safer and more focused.
**Action:** Always pick the single most impactful optimization that fits the task's scope and ensure all necessary dependencies (like `React.memo` or `useMemo`) are correctly handled within the single context.

**Learning:** Typing in a centralized search form with multiple input fields can trigger expensive re-renders across the entire form and its parent if callbacks aren't stabilized. `React.memo` alone is insufficient if the parent passes fresh function references on every keystroke.

**Action:** When optimizing form components, always use `useCallback` for event handlers alongside `React.memo` for sub-components to ensure that only the field being typed in re-renders.

## 2026-03-05 - ⚡ Bolt: CSS-based Hover States
**Learning:** React state-driven hover effects (`onMouseEnter/Leave`) can cause excessive re-renders in large lists or grids. Replacing them with CSS `group-hover` eliminates JavaScript execution and Virtual DOM diffing during high-frequency interactions.
**Action:** Always check if a hover effect can be achieved via CSS before reaching for `useState`.
